# üìò Insurance Premium Prediction & Data Segmentation Kit

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks focused on **Insurance Premium Prediction** with variations in dataset segments and preprocessing. The work includes data cleaning, outlier detection, and model preparation for different target audiences (rest vs. young) and additional visualizations.

## üìÅ Notebooks Included
### `data_segmentation.ipynb`
_No markdown description found in the notebook._

### `Prem_Insurance_Prediction_rest_with_gr.ipynb`
**Purpose**: As some of the columns have space between words and some have underscore, it would be better if all are in same format and here I wish this all column names to be in snake format(underscore) and turining it to lower letter. So

**Summary**:
##### As some of the columns have space between words and some have underscore, it would be better if all are in same format and here I wish this all column names to be in snake format(underscore) and turining it to lower letter. So

##### Check and handle NA values and Duplicate values

##### From above describe() we are understand about some outliers in each field. It's needed to be handled

##### <span style="color:red">Handling Outliers in No_of_Dependants.</span>

##### <span style="color:red">Handling Outliers in Age.</span>

##### <span style="color:red">Handling Outliers in Income.</span>
